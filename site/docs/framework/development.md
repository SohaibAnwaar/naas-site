# Development Environment

In this page, you will learn about the Naas Development Environment. A development environment refers to the collection of processes and tools used to develop the source code for a program or software product. It provides developers with the necessary resources and tools to write, test, and debug code efficiently.

## Tools and Technologies

Our development environment utilizes a range of tools and technologies to facilitate the development process. It includes:

- Python as Programming language
- JupyterLab as Integrated Development Environments
- GitHub as Version control systems
- GitHub actions as Build tool
- Black and Flake8 as Formating tool
- Pytest as Testing framework
- Sentry as Debugging tools and monitoring

## Development Workflow

To ensure a streamlined development process, we follow a specific workflow. This workflow typically includes the following steps:

1. **Planning and Requirements:** Understand the project requirements and plan the development process accordingly.
2. **Code Development:** Write, test, and refine the source code using the appropriate programming language and tools.
3. **Version Control:** Utilize version control systems to manage code changes, collaborate with team members, and track project history.
4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure code functionality, reliability, and performance.
5. **Documentation:** Document the codebase, including API references, user guides, and technical documentation.
6. **Continuous Integration and Deployment:** Automate build processes, perform continuous integration, and deploy the software to appropriate environments.
7. **Collaboration and Communication:** Foster effective collaboration and communication within the development team, utilizing tools like project management platforms and communication channels.
