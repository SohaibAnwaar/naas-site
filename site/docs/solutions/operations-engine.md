### Schema

The data contract might look something like this:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "DATE": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date",
      "description": "The date of the activity."
    },
    "DEPARTMENT": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The department that performed the activity."
    },
    "ACTIVITY": {
      "type": "string",

      "description": "The value of the key metric."
    }
  },
  "required": ["DATE", "DEPARTMENT", "ACTIVITY", "OUTPUT", "KEY METRIC", "METRIC VALUE"]

```

### Intergrations

For integrations, a Company Activity Dashboard could potentially connect with:

1. **Project Management Systems** like Asana, Jira, or Trello. These can provide data on tasks, projects, and overall activity within the organization.
2. **CRM Systems** like Salesforce or HubSpot. These can provide data on sales activities, deals closed, revenue, etc.
3. **Marketing Platforms** like Google Ads or Mailchimp. These can provide data on marketing campaigns, leads generated, etc.
4. **HR Systems** like BambooHR or Workday. These can provide data on hiring activities, positions filled, etc.
5. **Production/Manufacturing Systems**. These can provide data on units produced, efficiency, etc.

Remember, the specifics of how the system integrates with these other tools will depend on the APIs or other interfaces provided by these tools, as well as the specific requirements of the Company Activity Dashboard system.
