### Receive Automated Email Reports

You will receive an email report detailing your daily or weekly content performance and providing recommendations. This report, featuring performance graphs and text analysis will help you understand how well you have performed over the month. You can customize this report and add other insights to meet your specific needs.

### Create Your Own Content Creation Prompt

### Consolidate Your LinkedIn Content

Collect all LinkedIn content (including content and metrics) published by your company and individuals, and compile it into a single database. This data can then be distributed across various channels such as Notion, Google Sheets, Excel, and more.

### Understand Your LinkedIn Engagement Rate

Enhance your understanding of the engagement rate on your posts, whether published individually or bundled into custom categories (such as engagement rate by topics). The engagement rate is calculated using the simple formula: (Comments + Likes + Shares) / Views.

### Follow LinkedIn Influencers' Content

To ensure you don't miss any valuable content that could aid your growth, consider following influencers. This will allow you to gain the best insights from their content and find inspiration for your own future posts.
