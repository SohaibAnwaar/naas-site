# Advanced usage

In the advanced stage of Naas and myChatGPT utilization, the focus shifts to adapting templates as integral parts of data products. It's about constructing comprehensive data interfaces such as dashboards, APIs, and creating sophisticated myChatGPT plugins as agents. The result is a potent blend of improved data visualization, accessibility, and enhanced user experience via custom plugins.

## Constructing AI Agents

An AI Agent can be conceptualized as a combination of a Large Language Model (LLM) and an Engine. The Engine comprises of the Core Model, Domains or Modules, and Plugins. 

Here's a basic breakdown:

- **AI Agent = LLM + Engine**
    - **Engine = Core Model + Domains/Modules + Plugins**
        - *Examples of Domains/Modules:*
            - Content Performance Analytics
            - Content Optimization Recommendations
            - AI-Driven Content Generation
        - *Examples of Plugins:*
            - Content-Engine-LinkedIn-Profile Plugin, which incorporates several tools and tasks:
                - LinkedIn: Get post stats and export to CSV
                - Plotly: Generate a bar chart and export as a PNG
                - FastAPI: Create an API aligned with Schema.org
                - OpenAI: Act as a Content Expert, providing data in JSON and generating Prompt/Completion.

By combining different components, you can design AI agents to handle specific data-related tasks. For example, an agent might use a Content-Engine-LinkedIn-Profile plugin to gather data, visualize it, expose an API, and generate content using OpenAI.
