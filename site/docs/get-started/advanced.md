We are thrilled to announce that we are working on some exciting things for advanced users. These additions are designed to give you even more control and flexibility in your data interactions.

## Vector Databases Integration

In the near future, we will be integrating vector databases into our platform. This enhancement will enable you to perform intricate queries and operations on your data, helping you extract more meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Fine-Tune Your Own Model in Naas Space

We are also developing a feature that will allow you to fine-tune your own models within the Naas space. This means you will have the ability to customize and optimize your models to better suit your specific needs, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of your data experiences.

## Fast Creation and Shipping of AI APIs
We are introducing a feature that will allow you to create and ship AI APIs quickly. This will enable you to expose your data and models as APIs, making it easier for other systems to interact with your data and use your models. This feature will significantly speed up the process of deploying your models and making them accessible to others.
## Constructing AI Agents

We're also working on a feature that will allow you to construct your own AI agents. This will involve combining multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to create sophisticated AI systems that can handle specific tasks, interact intelligently with users, and provide nuanced responses. This will make your data exploration and analysis even more interactive and intuitive.

## Enhanced Naas Chat

Our forthcoming features will include improvements to Naas Chat. We are developing new plugins and modules that will make Naas Chat even more powerful and versatile.

Stay tuned.
We can't wait to show you what we've been working on!
