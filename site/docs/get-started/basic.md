2. **Interact with the AI Assistant:** Once you've chosen a plugin, you can start interacting with the AI assistant. The interaction will follow the scenario outlined by the plugin. For example, if you chose the "Act as a CEO" plugin, the AI assistant will help you make strategic decisions for your company.
